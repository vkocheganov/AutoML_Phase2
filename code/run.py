# Usage: python run.py input_dir output_dir

# This sample code can be used either 
# - to submit RESULTS depostited in the res/ subdirectory or 
# - as a template for CODE submission.
#
# The input directory input_dir contains 5 subdirectories named by dataset,
# including:
# 	dataname/dataname_feat.type          -- the feature type "Numerical", "Binary", or "Categorical" (Note: if this file is abscent, get the feature type from the dataname.info file)
# 	dataname/dataname_public.info        -- parameters of the data and task, including metric and time_budget
# 	dataname/dataname_test.data          -- training, validation and test data (solutions/target values are given for training data only)
# 	dataname/dataname_train.data
# 	dataname/dataname_train.solution
# 	dataname/dataname_valid.data
#
# The output directory will receive the predicted values (no subdirectories):
# 	dataname_test_000.predict            -- Provide predictions at regular intervals to make sure you get some results even if the program crashes
# 	dataname_test_001.predict
# 	dataname_test_002.predict
# 	...
# 	dataname_valid_000.predict
# 	dataname_valid_001.predict
# 	dataname_valid_002.predict
# 	...
# 
# Result submission:
# =================
# Search for @RESULT to locate that part of the code.
# ** Always keep this code. **
# If the subdirectory res/ contains result files (predicted values)
# the code just copies them to the output and does not train/test models.
# If no results are found, a model is trained and tested (see code submission).
#
# Code submission:
# ===============
# Search for @CODE to locate that part of the code.
# ** You may keep or modify this template or subtitute your own code. **
# The program saves predictions regularly. This way the program produces
# at least some results if it dies (or is terminated) prematurely. 
# This also allows us to plot learning curves. The last result is used by the
# scoring program.
# We implemented 2 classes:
# 1) DATA LOADING:
#    ------------
# Use/modify 
#                  D = DataManager(basename, input_dir, ...) 
# to load and preprocess data.
#     Missing values --
#       Our default method for replacing missing values is trivial: they are replaced by 0.
#       We also add extra indicator features where missing values occurred. This doubles the number of features.
#     Categorical variables --
#       The location of potential Categorical variable is indicated in D.feat_type.
#       NOTHING special is done about them in this sample code. 
#     Feature selection --
#       We only implemented an ad hoc feature selection filter efficient for the 
#       dorothea dataset to show that performance improves significantly 
#       with that filter. It takes effect only for binary classification problems with sparse
#       matrices as input and unbalanced classes.
# 2) LEARNING MACHINE:
#    ----------------
# Use/modify 
#                 M = MyAutoML(D.info, ...) 
# to create a model.
#     Number of base estimators --
#       Our models are ensembles. Adding more estimators may improve their accuracy.
#       Use M.model.n_estimators = num
#     Training --
#       M.fit(D.data['X_train'], D.data['Y_train'])
#       Fit the parameters and hyper-parameters (all inclusive!)
#       What we implemented hard-codes hyper-parameters, you probably want to
#       optimize them. Also, we made a somewhat arbitrary choice of models in
#       for the various types of data, just to give some baseline results.
#       You probably want to do better model selection and/or add your own models.
#     Testing --
#       Y_valid = M.predict(D.data['X_valid'])
#       Y_test = M.predict(D.data['X_test'])

# =========================== BEGIN USER OPTIONS ==============================
# Verbose mode: 
##############
# Recommended to keep verbose = True: shows various progression messages
verbose = True # outputs messages to stdout and stderr for debug purposes

# Debug level:
############## 
# 0: run the code normally, using the time budget of the tasks
# 1: run the code normally, but limits the time to max_time
# 2: run everything, but do not train, generate random outputs in max_time
# 3: stop before the loop on datasets
# 4: just list the directories and program version
debug_mode = 0

# Time budget
#############
# Maximum time of training in seconds PER DATASET (there are 5 datasets). 
# The code should keep track of time spent and NOT exceed the time limit 
# in the dataset "info" file, stored in D.info['time_budget'], see code below.
# If debug >=1, you can decrease the maximum time (in sec) with this variable:
max_time = 90 

# Maximum number of cycles
##########################
# Your training algorithm may be fast, so you may want to limit anyways the 
# number of points on your learning curve (this is on a log scale, so each 
# point uses twice as many time than the previous one.)
